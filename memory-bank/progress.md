## Known Issues

As the project is in its initial phase, there are no implementation-specific issues yet. However, the following challenges have been identified:

1. **API Integration**: Integrating with multiple external APIs (OpenAI, SerperDev, PubMed, arXiv, Semantic Scholar) will require careful management of rate limits, error handling, and cost considerations.

2. **LLM Limitations**: Large Language Models have context window limitations that may affect the processing of extensive research data and article creation.

3. **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of generated content will require robust validation mechanisms.

4. **Performance Optimization**: The article creation process may be time-consuming due to multiple API calls and LLM processing, requiring optimization strategies.

5. **API Key Management**: Secure handling of API keys while allowing for easy configuration will be a challenge.

## Next Milestones

The following milestones are targeted for the near future:

1. **Complete Project Setup** (Target: Week 1)
   - Finish setting up the development environment
   - Install all dependencies
   - Configure environment variables

2. **Implement Core Models** (Target: Week 1-2)
   - Define all Pydantic models for article structure
   - Implement validation logic
   - Create serialization/deserialization functionality

3. **Develop Basic CLI** (Target: Week 2)
   - Implement command-line interface
   - Add basic commands for article creation
   - Create help documentation

4. **Create Storage System** (Target: Week 2-3)
   - Implement JSON storage

   - Implement basic search functionality
   - Test agent capabilities

## Recent Achievements

As this is the initial phase of the project, the main achievement is the establishment of the memory bank and the definition of the project plan.

## Blockers

There are no specific blockers at this time, but the following dependencies need to be addressed:

1. **API Keys**: Obtain necessary API keys for external services (OpenAI, SerperDev, PubMed, etc.)

2. **Development Environment**: Set up the development environment with all required dependencies

## Notes

- The project timeline is an estimate and may be adjusted based on progress and challenges encountered.
- The implementation strategy prioritizes establishing a solid foundation before adding more complex features.
- Regular updates to this progress tracker will be made as the project advances.
