## Known Issues

The following challenges have been identified:

1.  **API Integration**: Integrating with multiple external APIs (Google Gemini, SerperDev, Semantic Scholar) will require careful management of rate limits, error handling, and cost considerations. (Note: `DirectGoogleScholarTool` test runs still show rate limit warnings from Google Scholar, which is an example of this).
2.  **LLM Limitations**: Large Language Models have context window limitations that may affect the processing of extensive research data and article creation. Gemini 2.0 Flash has a 1M token context window, which should be sufficient for most use cases, but we may need to use Gemini 2.5 Pro for tasks that require larger context windows.
3.  **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of generated content will require robust validation mechanisms.
4.  **Performance Optimization**: The article creation process may be time-consuming due to multiple API calls and LLM processing, requiring optimization strategies.
5.  **API Key Management**: Secure handling of API keys while allowing for easy configuration will be a challenge.
6.  **PDF Processing**: Converting PDFs to markdown format may be challenging due to the variety of PDF formats and structures. The Marker package will help, but we may need additional processing for certain types of PDFs.
7.  **Search Term Expansion**: Balancing between comprehensive coverage and focused research will be challenging when expanding search terms based on related terms from Google Scholar.
