## Known Issues

The following challenges have been identified:

1. **API Integration**: Integrating with multiple external APIs (Google Gemini, SerperDev, PubMed, arXiv, Semantic Scholar) will require careful management of rate limits, error handling, and cost considerations.

2. **LLM Limitations**: Large Language Models have context window limitations that may affect the processing of extensive research data and article creation. Gemini 2.0 Flash has a 1M token context window, which should be sufficient for most use cases.

3. **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of generated content will require robust validation mechanisms.

4. **Performance Optimization**: The article creation process may be time-consuming due to multiple API calls and LLM processing, requiring optimization strategies.

5. **API Key Management**: Secure handling of API keys while allowing for easy configuration will be a challenge.

## Next Milestones

The following milestones are targeted for the near future:

1. **Gemini Integration Testing** (Target: 1-2 weeks)
   - Test the system with Gemini models
   - Validate output quality and performance
   - Adjust prompts if needed for optimal results

2. **Comprehensive Testing** (Target: 2-3 weeks)
   - Implement unit tests for all components
   - Perform integration testing for agent interactions
   - Conduct end-to-end testing for the complete workflow

3. **Performance Optimization** (Target: 1-2 weeks)
   - Identify and address bottlenecks
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Optimize API usage

4. **Documentation Completion** (Target: 1-2 weeks)
   - Complete code documentation
   - Create user guides
   - Document API usage and rate limits

## Recent Achievements

The main achievements in this phase are:

1. **Gemini Model Integration**: Refactored the codebase to use Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash models instead of OpenAI models, providing a good balance of performance, quality, and cost with a 1M token context window.

2. **LLM Factory Implementation**: Created a factory utility for creating LLM instances with the appropriate configuration for Gemini models, centralizing model configuration and making it easier to switch between different models.

3. **End-to-End Workflow Implementation**: Implemented a flow that orchestrates the entire knowledge base article creation process, including research, content creation, review, and quality assessment.

7. **Risk Assessment System**: Implemented a risk assessment system that identifies potential issues in generated articles and determines a confidence level.

## Blockers

There are no specific blockers at this time, but the following dependencies need to be addressed:

1. **API Keys**: Obtain necessary API keys for external services (Google Gemini, SerperDev, PubMed, etc.)

2. **Development Environment**: Set up the development environment with all required dependencies

## Notes

- The project timeline is an estimate and may be adjusted based on progress and challenges encountered.
