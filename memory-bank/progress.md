# CrewKB Progress Tracker

This document tracks the progress of the CrewKB project, including what has been completed, what's in progress, what's left to build, and known issues.

## What Works

As the project is in its implementation and testing phase, the following components are currently working:

1.  **Memory Bank**: The core memory bank files have been created to document the project:
    *   `projectbrief.md`: Core requirements and goals
    *   `productContext.md`: Problem statement and user experience goals
    *   `systemPatterns.md`: System architecture and component relationships
    *   `techContext.md`: Technologies and dependencies
    *   `activeContext.md`: Current focus and next steps
    *   `progress.md`: This file, tracking project status
    *   `.clinerules`: Captures project intelligence and user preferences, including the preference to ignore Flake8 errors unless specified.

2.  **Project Planning**: The overall project plan has been established, including:
    *   System architecture design
    *   Component relationships
    *   Implementation phases
    *   Agent roles and responsibilities

3.  **Core Models**: The Pydantic models for article structure have been defined.
4.  **Storage System**: The basic storage system has been implemented.
5.  **CLI Structure**: The basic CLI structure has been defined.
6.  **YAML Configuration Files**: The directory structure and initial YAML files have been created.
7.  **Research Agents**: Implemented.
8.  **Research Tasks**: Implemented.
9.  **Search Tools**:
    *   SerperDevTool, PubMedSearchTool, GoogleScholarTool, WebpageScraperTool, SemanticScholarTool implemented.
    *   `DirectGoogleScholarTool`: Fixed TypeErrors related to `BrowserConfig` and `CrawlerRunConfig` parameters. Implemented basic stealth enhancements (`user_agent_mode="random"`, `magic=True` in `arun` call).
10. **Research Crew**: Implemented.
11. **CLI Research Command**: Implemented.
12. **Content Creation Agents**: Implemented.
13. **Content Creation Tasks**: Implemented.
14. **Content Tools**: Implemented.
15. **Content Creation Crew**: Implemented.
16. **CLI Create Command**: Implemented.
17. **Review Agents**: Implemented.
18. **Review Tasks**: Implemented.
19. **Tool System Refactoring**: Completed.
20. **Review Crew**: Implemented.
21. **CLI Review Command**: Implemented.
22. **End-to-End Workflow**: Implemented.
23. **CLI Generate Command**: Implemented.
24. **Metrics Collection System**: Implemented.
25. **CLI Metrics Command**: Implemented.
26. **CLI Visualize Flow Command**: Implemented.
27. **LLM Factory**: Implemented.

    *   `test_direct_google_scholar_tool.py`: Fixed `RuntimeWarning: coroutine '_async_run' was never awaited` by ensuring the coroutine object is closed in the relevant test. Tests for this tool now pass.

## What's In Progress

The following components are currently in progress:

1.  **Gemini Integration Testing**: Testing the system with Gemini models to ensure compatibility and optimal performance.
2.  **Testing and Refinement**: The testing and refinement of the end-to-end workflow is in progress. This includes ongoing review of test outputs for warnings (e.g., rate limit warnings).
3.  **Documentation**: The documentation of the system is in progress.
4.  **Additional Search Tools Testing**: Testing and refinement of the newly implemented search tools.
5.  **Stealth/Best Practices for `DirectGoogleScholarTool`**: Further enhancements can be explored (e.g., `StealthConfig`, proxy support, more headers).

## What's Left to Build

The following components are planned but not yet started:

### Phase 1: Additional Tool Implementation

1.  **Additional Search Tools**:
    *   ArXivSearchTool
2.  **Additional Validation Tools**:
    *   StructureValidatorTool
    *   HallucinationDetectorTool
3.  **Tool Factory Configuration**:
    *   Add dynamic tool configuration

### Phase 5: Testing and Refinement (In Progress)
... (rest of the section unchanged, but note that DirectGoogleScholarTool tests are now passing)

## Current Status

The project is in the **testing and refinement phase** with a focus on Gemini model integration. Key infrastructure like the memory bank, agent systems, tool systems (including fixes and basic stealth for `DirectGoogleScholarTool`), workflows, and CLI are largely complete. `DirectGoogleScholarTool` tests are now passing after resolving TypeErrors and a coroutine warning. The codebase has been refactored to use Google's Gemini models. The next steps involve broader testing, refinement, and implementation of remaining tools and features.

## Known Issues

The following challenges have been identified:

1.  **API Integration**: Integrating with multiple external APIs (Google Gemini, SerperDev, PubMed, arXiv, Semantic Scholar) will require careful management of rate limits, error handling, and cost considerations. (Note: `DirectGoogleScholarTool` test runs still show rate limit warnings from Google Scholar, which is an example of this).
2.  **LLM Limitations**: Large Language Models have context window limitations that may affect the processing of extensive research data and article creation. Gemini 2.0 Flash has a 1M token context window, which should be sufficient for most use cases.
3.  **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of generated content will require robust validation mechanisms.
4.  **Performance Optimization**: The article creation process may be time-consuming due to multiple API calls and LLM processing, requiring optimization strategies.
5.  **API Key Management**: Secure handling of API keys while allowing for easy configuration will be a challenge.

## Next Milestones

The following milestones are targeted for the near future:

1.  **Gemini Integration Testing** (Target: 1-2 weeks)
    *   Test the system with Gemini models
    *   Validate output quality and performance

3.  **Performance Optimization** (Target: 1-2 weeks)
    *   Identify and address bottlenecks
    *   Implement caching strategies
    *   Optimize API usage
4.  **Documentation Completion** (Target: 1-2 weeks)
    *   Complete code documentation
    *   Create user guides
