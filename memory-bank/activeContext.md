# CrewKB Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus of the CrewKB project is on establishing the foundation for the knowledge base creation system. This includes:

1. **Project Setup**: Creating the basic project structure, setting up the development environment, and establishing the memory bank.

2. **Core Architecture Design**: Defining the system architecture, component relationships, and workflow patterns.

3. **Agent System Design**: Designing the specialized agents that will collaborate to create knowledge base articles.

4. **Article Structure Definition**: Defining the Pydantic models that will structure the knowledge base articles.

5. **Tool Implementation Planning**: Planning the implementation of custom tools for search, content creation, and validation.

## Recent Changes

As this is the initial phase of the project, there are no recent changes to report. The project is currently in the planning and setup stage.

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for the project are:

   - Create PubMedSearchTool
   - Create ArXivSearchTool
   - Create SemanticScholarSearchTool

2. **Content Tools**:
   - Create OutlineGeneratorTool
   - Create CitationFormatterTool
   - Create ContentStructureTool

3. **Validation Tools**:
   - Create FactCheckerTool
   - Create StructureValidatorTool
   - Create HallucinationDetectorTool

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Agent Granularity**: We've decided to create specialized agents with focused roles rather than more general-purpose agents. This approach aligns with CrewAI best practices and allows for more precise control over the article creation process.

2. **Workflow Design**: We're implementing different workflows for different types of biomedical topics (diseases, biomarkers, lab tests) to accommodate the unique requirements of each article type.

3. **Storage Strategy**: We've chosen to store articles in both JSON and Markdown formats to support both programmatic access and human readability.

### Technical Considerations

1. **API Selection**: We need to evaluate and select the most appropriate APIs for search functionality, considering factors like cost, rate limits, and data quality.

2. **LLM Provider**: We need to determine which LLM provider(s) to use, considering factors like performance, cost, and context window size.

3. **Error Handling**: We need to design robust error handling mechanisms to manage API failures, LLM limitations, and other potential issues.

### Open Questions

1. **Search Implementation**: What is the most effective way to implement search across multiple sources while managing rate limits and costs?

2. **Quality Assurance**: How can we best validate the accuracy of generated content and detect potential hallucinations?

3. **Performance Optimization**: How can we optimize the article creation process to reduce latency and resource usage?

4. **API Key Management**: What is the best approach for managing API keys securely while allowing for easy configuration?

### Current Priorities

1. **Project Structure**: Establishing a clean, modular project structure that supports extensibility and maintainability.

2. **Core Models**: Defining the Pydantic models that will structure the knowledge base articles.

3. **Basic Workflow**: Implementing a simple end-to-end workflow to validate the overall approach.

4. **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive documentation to support ongoing development.

## Recent Insights

As this is the initial phase of the project, we're still gathering insights. Key considerations that have emerged from the planning process include:

1. **Modular Design**: The importance of a modular design that allows for easy extension and modification of the system.

2. **Agent Specialization**: The value of creating specialized agents with clear roles and responsibilities.

3. **Workflow Flexibility**: The need for flexible workflows that can adapt to different article types and research requirements.

4. **Quality Control**: The critical importance of robust quality control mechanisms to ensure accuracy and reliability.

These insights will guide the implementation of the CrewKB system and inform ongoing development decisions.
