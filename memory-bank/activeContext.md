## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Flow-Based Architecture**: We've implemented a flow-based architecture for the end-to-end workflow, which provides a structured, event-driven approach to AI workflows. This allows for better state management, error handling, and visualization.

2. **Metrics Collection Approach**: We're using a metrics collection system that tracks and analyzes the quality of generated articles. This provides valuable insights into the performance of the system and helps identify areas for improvement.

3. **Quality Assessment System**: We've implemented a quality assessment system that evaluates the accuracy, readability, and patient relevance of generated articles. This ensures that the articles meet high standards of quality.

4. **Risk Assessment System**: We've implemented a risk assessment system that identifies potential issues in generated articles and determines a confidence level. This helps users understand the reliability of the generated content.

### Technical Considerations

1. **API Selection**: We're using the SerperDev API for web search and the Entrez API for PubMed search. These APIs provide structured data that can be easily processed by the agents.

2. **LLM Provider**: We're using Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model for the agents, as it provides a good balance of performance, quality, and cost with its 1M token context window.

3. **Error Handling**: We've implemented error handling in the tools, crews, and flows to manage API failures and other potential issues.

4. **Citation Validation**: We've implemented robust citation validation to ensure that all factual statements are properly attributed to reliable sources.

5. **Performance Optimization**: We're working on optimizing the article creation process to reduce latency and resource usage. This includes implementing caching strategies and optimizing API usage.

### Open Questions

1. **Metrics Refinement**: How can we refine the quality metrics to better reflect the actual quality of the articles?

2. **Performance Optimization**: What additional strategies can we implement to further optimize the article creation process?

3. **API Key Management**: What is the best approach for managing API keys securely while allowing for easy configuration?

4. **Gemini Model Selection**: Should we experiment with other Gemini models like gemini-1.5-pro (2M tokens) for tasks that might benefit from larger context windows or more advanced reasoning?

5. **Prompt Engineering**: Do we need to adjust our prompts to better align with Gemini models' capabilities and response patterns?

4. **Quality Assurance**: How can we further enhance the quality assurance system to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the generated content?

5. **User Experience**: How can we improve the user experience of the CLI to make it more intuitive and user-friendly?

### Current Priorities

1. **Gemini Integration Testing**: Testing the system with Gemini models to ensure compatibility and optimal performance.

2. **Testing and Refinement**: Implementing comprehensive testing for the system and refining the end-to-end workflow.
