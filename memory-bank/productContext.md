# CrewKB Product Context

## Why CrewKB Exists

CrewKB exists to address the challenge of creating comprehensive, accurate, and structured knowledge base articles on biomedical topics. Traditional approaches to knowledge base creation often face several limitations:

1. **Manual Research Intensity**: Creating high-quality medical content requires extensive research across multiple sources, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive.

2. **Consistency Challenges**: Maintaining consistent structure and quality across numerous articles is difficult, especially when multiple authors are involved.

3. **Accuracy Concerns**: Medical information must be accurate and up-to-date, requiring rigorous fact-checking and citation.

4. **Scale Limitations**: The breadth of biomedical knowledge makes it challenging to scale content creation while maintaining quality.

CrewKB leverages the Crew.AI framework to overcome these challenges by creating an autonomous system of specialized agents that collaborate to research, create, and review knowledge base articles.

## Problems CrewKB Solves

### For Content Creators and Medical Information Providers

1. **Research Efficiency**: Automates the process of gathering information from multiple reputable sources, significantly reducing research time.

2. **Structural Consistency**: Ensures all articles follow a predefined structure, making information easier to navigate and compare.

3. **Quality Control**: Implements systematic review processes to maintain accuracy and prevent misinformation.

4. **Scalability**: Enables the creation of large volumes of content without compromising on quality or consistency.

5. **Citation Management**: Automatically tracks and formats citations to ensure proper attribution and verifiability.

### For End Users of Medical Knowledge Bases

1. **Comprehensive Information**: Provides thorough coverage of biomedical topics with consistent depth and breadth.

2. **Reliable Content**: Ensures information is sourced from reputable scientific literature and properly cited.

3. **Navigable Structure**: Presents information in a consistent format that makes it easy to find specific details.

4. **Up-to-date Knowledge**: Facilitates regular updates to reflect the latest research and medical guidelines.

## How CrewKB Works

CrewKB operates through a collaborative system of specialized AI agents, each with distinct roles and responsibilities:

### Research Phase

1. **Topic Selection**: The process begins with a topic or keywords for a knowledge base article.

2. **Literature Research**: Research agents search and analyze scientific literature from multiple sources (Google Scholar, PubMed, arXiv, etc.).

3. **Information Extraction**: Relevant information is extracted and organized according to the article structure.

### Content Creation Phase

1. **Outline Development**: Content architects create comprehensive outlines based on research findings.

2. **Section Drafting**: Content writers develop each section of the article following the predefined structure.

3. **Citation Management**: Citations are properly formatted and linked to claims throughout the article.

### Review Phase

1. **Accuracy Verification**: Review agents check facts against source materials to ensure accuracy.

2. **Hallucination Detection**: Content is analyzed to identify and correct any unsupported claims.

3. **Structural Validation**: Articles are verified to ensure they adhere to the required format and structure.

4. **Readability Assessment**: Content is evaluated for clarity and accessibility to non-specialist readers.

### Iterative Improvement

The system supports non-deterministic workflows where agents can autonomously decide to:

1. Request additional research on specific topics
2. Revise sections that need improvement
3. Expand areas that lack sufficient detail
4. Cycle back to previous phases as needed
