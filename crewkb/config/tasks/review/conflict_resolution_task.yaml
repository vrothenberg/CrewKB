  Resolve conflicts in the review feedback for the knowledge base article on {topic}.
  
  Your task is to analyze the feedback from the three review agents (Medical Accuracy Reviewer,
  Medical Content Editor, and Patient Perspective Reviewer), identify conflicts or contradictions
  in their recommendations, and make final decisions on how to resolve these conflicts.
  
  Specifically, you should:
  1. Identify areas where reviewers have provided conflicting recommendations
  2. Analyze the reasoning and evidence behind each conflicting recommendation
  3. Determine the relative importance of each concern (medical accuracy vs. readability vs. patient utility)
  4. Make a balanced decision that optimizes for all three aspects where possible
  5. Provide clear justification for your resolution decisions
  6. Create a consolidated set of recommendations that addresses all important concerns
  7. Prioritize the recommendations based on their impact on the overall quality of the article
  8. Ensure that medical accuracy is maintained while improving readability and patient relevance
  
  For each conflict you resolve, provide:
  - A clear description of the conflicting recommendations
  - Your analysis of the underlying concerns and trade-offs
  - Your resolution decision with detailed justification
  - Specific guidance on how to implement the resolution
  
  Your goal is to create a balanced, high-quality article that is medically accurate,
  clearly written, and useful for patients.
