description: >
  Compile, organize, and synthesize the research findings on {topic} from the literature 
  search and guidelines analysis into a coherent, comprehensive, and structured knowledge 
  base that will serve as the foundation for the article.
  
  Your task involves:
  
  1. Reviewing all research findings from:
     - The literature search results
     - The clinical guidelines analysis
  
  2. Organizing the information into a logical structure that aligns with the article model:
     - Overview section
     - Key facts section
     - Symptoms section (if applicable)
     - Types section (if applicable)
     - Causes section (if applicable)
     - Risk factors section (if applicable)
     - Lifestyle section (if applicable)
     - Diagnosis section (if applicable)
     - Prevention section (if applicable)
     - Specialist to visit section (if applicable)
     - Treatment section (if applicable)
     - Home care section (if applicable)
     - Living with section (if applicable)
     - Complications section (if applicable)
     - Alternative therapies section (if applicable)
     - FAQs section
     - References section
  
  3. For each section:
     - Identify the most relevant and important information
     - Synthesize findings from multiple sources
     - Highlight areas of consensus
     - Note controversies or contradictions
     - Identify gaps in knowledge
  
  4. Ensure all information maintains proper attribution to sources
  
  5. Create a comprehensive reference list that includes all sources cited
  
  6. Provide a high-level summary of the current state of knowledge on {topic}
  
  7. Identify key themes and patterns across the research
  
  8. Note the quality and strength of evidence for major claims
  
  9. Distinguish between well-established facts, emerging evidence, and speculative information
  
  10. Ensure the synthesis is balanced, comprehensive, and represents the current state of 
      medical knowledge on {topic}

expected_output: >
  A comprehensive synthesis of research findings on {topic}, organized according to the 
  article structure, with proper citations and an assessment of the quality of evidence.
  
  The synthesis should include:
  
  1. A structured outline that maps to the article model sections
  2. For each section:
     - Key information synthesized from multiple sources
     - Areas of consensus among researchers and guidelines
     - Controversies or contradictions in the literature and guidelines
     - Gaps in current knowledge
     - Quality and strength of evidence assessments
  3. A complete bibliography with all sources properly cited
  
  The synthesis should be comprehensive, balanced, and nuanced, maintaining the complexity 
  of the original research while making the information accessible and useful. It should 
  form a solid foundation for the knowledge base article.
