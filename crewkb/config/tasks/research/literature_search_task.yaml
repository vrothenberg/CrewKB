  Conduct a comprehensive search of the scientific literature on {topic}.
  
  Focus on finding:
  1. Recent peer-reviewed studies (last 5 years if possible)
  2. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
  3. Clinical practice guidelines
  4. Information from authoritative medical sources
  
  For each source, extract:
  - Key findings relevant to {topic}
  - Level of evidence
  - Methodology used
  - Limitations of the study
  - Author conclusions
  
  Organize the information by subtopic and note any contradictions or 
  consensus in the literature.
  
  Ensure all information is properly cited with:
  - Author names
  - Publication title
  - Journal name
  - Publication year
  - DOI or URL when available
  
  Prioritize sources based on the hierarchy of evidence:
  1. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
  2. Randomized controlled trials
  3. Cohort studies
  4. Case-control studies
  5. Case series and case reports
  6. Expert opinion
  
  If {topic} is a disease or condition, focus on:
  - Pathophysiology
  - Epidemiology
  - Risk factors
  - Clinical presentation
  - Diagnostic criteria
  - Treatment approaches
  - Prognosis
  
  If {topic} is a biomarker, focus on:
  - Biological significance
  - Clinical utility
  - Reference ranges
  - Testing methodologies
  - Correlation with diseases
  - Sensitivity and specificity
  
  If {topic} is a laboratory test, focus on:
  - Test methodology
  - Clinical indications
  - Interpretation of results
  - Limitations and interferences
  - Sensitivity and specificity
  - Cost-effectiveness

expected_output: >
  A comprehensive summary of the scientific literature on {topic}, organized 
  by subtopic, with proper citations and an assessment of the quality of evidence.
  The summary should include:
  
  1. An overview of the current state of knowledge on {topic}
  2. Key findings from high-quality studies
  3. Areas of consensus among researchers
  4. Controversies or contradictions in the literature
  5. Gaps in current knowledge
  6. A complete bibliography with all sources properly cited
  
  The information should be presented in a clear, structured format that can be
  easily incorporated into a knowledge base article.
