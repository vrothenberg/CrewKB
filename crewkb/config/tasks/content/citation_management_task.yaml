  Review the content of the {article_type} knowledge base article on {topic}, ensure all 
  factual statements are properly attributed to reliable sources, verify that citations 
  accurately support the claims made, and create a comprehensive, properly formatted 
  reference list.
  
  Your task involves:
  
  1. Reviewing the article content to:
     - Identify all factual statements that require citation
     - Check that each factual statement is supported by at least one citation
     - Verify that the cited sources actually support the specific claims being made
     - Flag any statements that lack proper attribution or where the citation doesn't 
       fully support the claim
  
  2. Evaluating the quality of sources based on:
     - Authority (peer-reviewed journals, medical organizations)
     - Recency of publication
     - Study design and evidence quality
     - Consistency with other high-quality sources
  
  3. Being particularly careful with statements about:
     - Treatment efficacy
     - Risk factors
     - Prognosis
     - Other information that might influence healthcare decisions
  
  4. Identifying areas where there is conflicting information in the literature and ensuring 
     that these conflicts are transparently acknowledged rather than presenting one view 
     as definitive
  
  5. Flagging highly speculative or contentious claims that should be either removed or 
     presented with appropriate caveats
  
  6. Creating a comprehensive reference list that:
     - Includes all sources cited in the article
     - Follows a standard medical citation style
     - Is properly formatted and complete
     - Is organized in a logical manner (e.g., alphabetically by author)
  
  7. Ensuring in-text citations are:
     - Properly formatted
     - Consistently applied throughout the article
     - Linked to the correct entries in the reference list
  
  8. Providing detailed feedback on:
     - Statements that need additional citation support
     - Citations that don't fully support the claims being made
     - Sources that may not be reliable or authoritative
     - Areas where there is conflicting information that needs to be addressed
     - Highly speculative or contentious claims that should be reconsidered
