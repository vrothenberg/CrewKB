description: >
  Analyze the research synthesis on {topic} and create a comprehensive, well-structured 
  outline for a {article_type} knowledge base article that organizes the information 
  in a logical, accessible format tailored for a general audience.
  
  Your task involves:
  
  1. Analyzing the research synthesis to identify:
     - Key information that must be included
     - Logical groupings of information
     - Priority of information based on importance to the target audience
     - Areas where there is conflicting information or uncertainty
     - Gaps that may need additional research
  
  2. Creating a detailed outline that:
     - Follows the article model structure
     - Adapts to the specific {article_type} (disease, biomarker, or lab test)
     - Organizes information in a logical flow
     - Prioritizes practical, actionable information
     - Includes all required sections
  
  3. For disease articles, ensure the outline:
     - Focuses on practical information for patients and caregivers
     - Emphasizes symptoms, treatments, and living with the condition
     - Includes clear "When to See a Doctor" guidance
     - Highlights prevention strategies where applicable
  
  4. For biomarker articles, ensure the outline:
     - Explains clinical significance in accessible language
     - Focuses on what test results mean for patients
     - Includes information on when/why the biomarker is tested
     - Minimizes technical details unless directly relevant to patients
  
  5. For lab test articles, ensure the outline:
     - Emphasizes practical aspects: preparation, procedure, results interpretation
     - Includes information on normal ranges and what abnormal results might indicate
     - Addresses common concerns (pain, fasting requirements, etc.)
     - Provides context on when/why tests are ordered
  
  6. For all article types, ensure the outline:
     - Structures content with the most important/common information first
     - Includes sections for addressing common questions
     - Provides clear organization that helps readers find specific information
     - Flags areas where there is conflicting information or uncertainty
  
  7. Flag any areas where:
     - Additional research may be needed
     - There are conflicting findings that need to be addressed
     - Information is highly technical and needs simplification
     - Information is speculative or contentious and should be presented with caution

expected_output: >
  A comprehensive, detailed outline for a {article_type} knowledge base article on {topic} 
  that follows the article model structure and is tailored to the specific article type.
  
  The outline should include:
  
  1. A high-level structure showing all major sections
  2. Detailed subsections with bullet points indicating key content to include
  3. Notes on areas requiring special attention (conflicting information, gaps, etc.)
  4. Guidance on content priorities and emphasis
  5. Suggestions for how to present complex or technical information
  
  The outline should be organized in a logical flow that guides readers from basic 
  information to more specific details, with practical, actionable information prioritized.
  It should be adapted to the specific article type (disease, biomarker, or lab test) 
  and should ensure that all key information from the research synthesis is included.
