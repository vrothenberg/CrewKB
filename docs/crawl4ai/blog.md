# Crawl4AI Blog
Welcome to the Crawl4AI blog! Here you'll find detailed release notes, technical insights, and updates about the project. Whether you're looking for the latest improvements or want to dive deep into web crawling techniques, this is the place.
## Latest Release
Here’s the blog index entry for **v0.6.0** , written to match the exact tone and structure of your previous entries:
### [Crawl4AI v0.6.0 – World-Aware Crawling, Pre-Warmed Browsers, and the MCP API](https://docs.crawl4ai.com/blog/releases/0.6.0/)
_April 23, 2025_
Crawl4AI v0.6.0 is our most powerful release yet. This update brings major architectural upgrades including world-aware crawling (set geolocation, locale, and timezone), real-time traffic capture, and a memory-efficient crawler pool with pre-warmed pages. 
The Docker server now exposes a full-featured MCP socket + SSE interface, supports streaming, and comes with a new Playground UI. Plus, table extraction is now native, and the new stress-test framework supports crawling 1,000+ URLs. 
Other key changes: 
  * Native support for `result.media["tables"]` to export DataFrames 
  * Full network + console logs and MHTML snapshot per crawl 
  * Browser pooling and pre-warming for faster cold starts 
  * New streaming endpoints via MCP API and Playground 
  * Robots.txt support, proxy rotation, and improved session handling 
  * Deprecated old markdown names, legacy modules cleaned up 
  * Massive repo cleanup: ~36K insertions, ~5K deletions across 121 files

### [Crawl4AI v0.5.0: Deep Crawling, Scalability, and a New CLI!](https://docs.crawl4ai.com/blog/releases/0.5.0/)
My dear friends and crawlers, there you go, this is the release of Crawl4AI v0.5.0! This release brings a wealth of new features, performance improvements, and a more streamlined developer experience. Here's a breakdown of what's new:
**Major New Features:**
  * **Deep Crawling:** Explore entire websites with configurable strategies (BFS, DFS, Best-First). Define custom filters and URL scoring for targeted crawls.
  * **Memory-Adaptive Dispatcher:** Handle large-scale crawls with ease! Our new dispatcher dynamically adjusts concurrency based on available memory and includes built-in rate limiting.
  * **Multiple Crawler Strategies:** Choose between the full-featured Playwright browser-based crawler or a new, _much_ faster HTTP-only crawler for simpler tasks.
  * **Docker Deployment:** Deploy Crawl4AI as a scalable, self-contained service with built-in API endpoints and optional JWT authentication.
  * **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Interact with Crawl4AI directly from your terminal. Crawl, configure, and extract data with simple commands.
  * **LLM Configuration (`LLMConfig`):** A new, unified way to configure LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.) for extraction, filtering, and schema generation. Simplifies API key management and switching between models.


**Minor Updates & Improvements:**
  * **LXML Scraping Mode:** Faster HTML parsing with `LXMLWebScrapingStrategy`.
  * **Proxy Rotation:** Added `ProxyRotationStrategy` with a `RoundRobinProxyStrategy` implementation.
  * **PDF Processing:** Extract text, images, and metadata from PDF files.
  * **URL Redirection Tracking:** Automatically follows and records redirects.
  * **Robots.txt Compliance:** Optionally respect website crawling rules.
  * **LLM-Powered Schema Generation:** Automatically create extraction schemas using an LLM.
  * **`LLMContentFilter`:** Generate high-quality, focused markdown using an LLM.
  * **Improved Error Handling & Stability:** Numerous bug fixes and performance enhancements.
  * **Enhanced Documentation:** Updated guides and examples.


**Breaking Changes & Migration:**
This release includes several breaking changes to improve the library's structure and consistency. Here's what you need to know:
  * **`arun_many()`Behavior:** Now uses the `MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher` by default. The return type depends on the `stream` parameter in `CrawlerRunConfig`. Adjust code that relied on unbounded concurrency.
  * **`max_depth`Location:** Moved to `CrawlerRunConfig` and now controls _crawl depth_.
  * **Deep Crawling Imports:** Import `DeepCrawlStrategy` and related classes from `crawl4ai.deep_crawling`.
  * **`BrowserContext`API:** Updated; the old `get_context` method is deprecated.
  * **Optional Model Fields:** Many data model fields are now optional. Handle potential `None` values.
  * **`ScrapingMode`Enum:** Replaced with strategy pattern (`WebScrapingStrategy`, `LXMLWebScrapingStrategy`).
  * **`content_filter`Parameter:** Removed from `CrawlerRunConfig`. Use extraction strategies or markdown generators with filters.
  * **Removed Functionality:** The synchronous `WebCrawler`, the old CLI, and docs management tools have been removed.
  * **Docker:** Significant changes to deployment. See the [Docker documentation](https://docs.crawl4ai.com/deploy/docker/README.md).
  * **`ssl_certificate.json`:** This file has been removed.
  * **Config** : FastFilterChain has been replaced with FilterChain
  * **Deep-Crawl** : DeepCrawlStrategy.arun now returns Union[CrawlResultT, List[CrawlResultT], AsyncGenerator[CrawlResultT, None]]
  * **Proxy** : Removed synchronous WebCrawler support and related rate limiting configurations
  * **LLM Parameters:** Use the new `LLMConfig` object instead of passing `provider`, `api_token`, `base_url`, and `api_base` directly to `LLMExtractionStrategy` and `LLMContentFilter`.


**In short:** Update imports, adjust `arun_many()` usage, check for optional fields, and review the Docker deployment guide.
## License Change
Crawl4AI v0.5.0 updates the license to Apache 2.0 _with a required attribution clause_. This means you are free to use, modify, and distribute Crawl4AI (even commercially), but you _must_ clearly attribute the project in any public use or distribution. See the updated `LICENSE` file for the full legal text and specific requirements.
**Get Started:**
  * **Installation:** `pip install "crawl4ai[all]"` (or use the Docker image)
  * **Documentation:** <https://docs.crawl4ai.com>
  * **GitHub:** <https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai>
